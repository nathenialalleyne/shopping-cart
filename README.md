**Shopping Cart Site Remake**
=============================
Welcome to my responsive shopping cart site. This project was developed as a way to demonstrate my understanding of React, Redux, and React Router, and my ability to build a responsive web application with a shopping cart functionality.

Some of the key features of the app include:

- A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Shopping cart functionality that allows users to add and remove items from the cart
- Use of Redux for state management
- Use of React Router for client-side routing

Built With

React, React Router, CSS, and Redux
